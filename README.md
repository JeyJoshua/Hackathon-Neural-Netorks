### Steel Plates Fault Detection

Steel plates fault is a dataset of steel plates faults, classified into 7 different
types. The goal was to train machine learning for automatic pattern recognition.
The dataset consists of 27 features describing each fault (location, size, ...)
and 1 feature indicating the type of fault (on of 7: Pastry, Z Scratch, K Scatch,
Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other Faults). The target is the type of fault.
